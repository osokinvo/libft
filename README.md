This is an educational project of school 42 https://42.fr (school 21 in Moscow https://21-school.ru).
The project helps to understand the operation of some standard functions.
Further projects within the educational program are based on these functions, and not on standard originals.
You can note in the project the management of ASCII strings, memory management, and the use of pointers.
Makefile is also present, which allows you to create object files and delete them.
